# Call Manager

Call Manager is an organizer for phone calls that you need to make. This app was written using Google Flutter SDK and features a beautful Material Design 2 interface.

Features:
- Add a phone call with a name, number, and optional call description. Each call will be added to a chronological list of Call Cards on the main screen.
- Options per Call Card:
	- Call
	- Send SMS
	- Edit Call
	- Set Notification Reminder
	- Delete Call
- Add a contact from your own contact list. The name and number fields will autofill with those details.
