# Call Manager

Call Manager is a cross-platform application for scheduling and keeping track of phone calls. Think of it as a "to-do" list, dedicated to phone calls.

Features:
- Add phone calls to your list as Call Cards. Call Cards have one-tap actions for accomplishing tasks for that call, like:
	- Call
	- Send SMS
	- Edit Call
	- Set Notification Reminder
	- Delete Call
- Clean, simple interface
- Light/dark/system themes

Call Manager is available on the Google Play Store and will be coming to Apple devices this year. You can also download the app right from the Releases section of this repository.
